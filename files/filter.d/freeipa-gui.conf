# Fail2ban filter for FreeIPA Web UI Authentication
# =============================================================================
# This filter detects failed authentication attempts to the FreeIPA Web UI.
# It monitors for unauthorized access attempts where users or services try to
# authenticate but fail because they don't exist in the Kerberos database.
#
# Usage:
#   - Place this file in your filter.d directory (e.g. /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/freeipa-gui.conf)
#   - Ensure your FreeIPA server is configured to log authentication failures
#   - Use with a corresponding jail configuration in jail.local
#
# Example log entry matched:
#   2024-01-01 12:00:00 [remote 192.168.1.100:12345] ipa: INFO: 401 Unauthorized: kinit: Client nonexistent_user@DOMAIN.COM not found in Kerberos database while getting initial credentials

# This regex captures:
#   - Remote IP address of the client
#   - 401 Unauthorized errors
#   - Kerberos database lookup failures

# Notes:
# =============================================================================
# - This filter specifically targets failed login attempts to the FreeIPA Web UI
# - It matches cases where the authentication fails due to non-existent users
# - The filter helps protect against brute force and dictionary attacks
# - Adjust the failregex if your FreeIPA log format differs
